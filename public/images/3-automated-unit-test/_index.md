## Automated Unit Testing Overview

This module focuses on implementing automated unit testing in our CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodeBuild. You'll learn how to write effective unit tests, configure test automation, and integrate test results into your development workflow.

### What You'll Learn

1. Writing Unit Tests
   - Creating test projects
   - Writing effective test cases
   - Implementing test patterns
   - Using xUnit framework

2. BuildSpec Configuration
   - Configuring test execution
   - Setting up test reporting
   - Managing test dependencies

3. Push and Trigger Testing
   - Automating test execution
   - Configuring build triggers
   - Managing test workflows

4. Viewing Test Results
   - Analyzing test reports
   - Interpreting test metrics
   - Tracking test coverage

5. Fixing Test Failures
   - Debugging failed tests
   - Implementing fixes
   - Validating corrections

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 2 (Environment Setup)
- Understanding of C# and .NET testing
