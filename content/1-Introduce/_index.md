"Automated Testing with AWS CodeBuild and Parallel Execution" is a hands-on workshop guiding participants to build a modern testing framework for a .NET 8 MVC web application.

Using a real-world movie streaming website with available unit tests, participants will:

Trigger tests automatically on each GitHub push

Implement parallel execution to speed up test runs

Integrate performance and security testing using CodeQL

Monitor test results and optimize build costs with AWS Cloud tools

This workshop is ideal for IT students, developers, and DevOps interns who want to master automated testing in a professional, scalable, and cost-effective cloud-based environment.
