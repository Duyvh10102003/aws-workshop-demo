# 2. Automated Unit Test Setup

In this section, you will set up an automated unit testing pipeline that runs every time you push code to GitHub. This ensures early detection of bugs and continuous software quality throughout development.

2.2 - Create `buildspec.yml` configuration  
2.3 - Configure automatic trigger on push  
2.4 - View test results in CodeBuild  
2.5 - Fix failing tests
