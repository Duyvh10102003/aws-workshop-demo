# Workshop: Automated Testing with AWS CodeBuild and Parallel Execution

### Overview

In this workshop, you'll learn how to build a modern automated testing system for a web application built with **.NET 8 MVC**, leveraging AWS services such as **CodeBuild, CloudWatch, and CodeQL**.

Through hands-on sessions, you will:
- Set up a CI pipeline to trigger tests on every GitHub push
- Accelerate test execution with parallel execution strategies
- Integrate performance and security testing (via CodeQL)
- Monitor logs, analyze test results, and optimize cost
- Clean up AWS resources after testing
