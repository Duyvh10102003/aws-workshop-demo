## Configuring Parallel Test Execution

### Configure AWS CodeBuild
[Insert screenshot: CodeBuild parallel configuration]
1. Update Build Project
   - Enable parallel builds
   - Configure compute resources
   - Set concurrency limits
   [Insert screenshot: Build settings]

2. Configure Build Specification
   [Insert screenshot: BuildSpec configuration]
   ```yaml
   version: 0.2
   batch:
     fast-fail: true
     build-graph:
       - identifier: UnitTests
         buildspec: unit.yml
       - identifier: IntegrationTests
         buildspec: integration.yml
   ```

### Set Up Test Parallelization
[Insert screenshot: Test parallel settings]
1. Configure Test Runner
   - Set max parallel tests
   - Configure test groups
   - Set execution order
   [Insert screenshot: Runner configuration]

2. Resource Management
   [Insert screenshot: Resource settings]
   - Memory allocation
   - CPU utilization
   - Network resources

### Environment Configuration
[Insert screenshot: Environment setup]
1. Configure Test Environments
   - Separate environments
   - Resource isolation
   - Data separation
   [Insert screenshot: Environment isolation]

2. Dependency Management
   [Insert screenshot: Dependency configuration]
   - Shared resources
   - External services
   - Test data

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Parallel configuration complete
- [ ] Resources allocated properly
- [ ] Environments isolated
- [ ] Dependencies managed
- [ ] Build succeeding

### Troubleshooting Guide
[Insert screenshot: Common parallel issues]
1. Resource Conflicts
   - Memory issues
   - CPU bottlenecks
   - Network contention

2. Environment Problems
   - Isolation failures
   - Resource sharing
   - Configuration conflicts

3. Build Issues
   - Concurrency problems
   - Timing issues
   - Resource limits

### Best Practices
[Insert screenshot: Parallel execution best practices]
1. Resource Management
   - Proper sizing
   - Load balancing
   - Resource monitoring

2. Test Organization
   - Independent tests
   - Grouped execution
   - Clear dependencies
