In this section, you'll extend your test framework to support running multiple test classes in parallel, reducing test time and improving efficiency.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Create multiple test classes
- Enable parallel execution for faster testing
- Aggregate test results into a unified report
- Compare sequential vs. parallel performance

## ðŸ§© Steps

| Step | Description | Path |
|------|-------------|------|
| 4.1 | Create multiple test classes | [4.1-multiple-tests](4.1-multiple-tests/) |
| 4.2 | Configure parallel test execution | [4.2-configure-parallel](4.2-configure-parallel/) |
| 4.3 | Aggregate all test results | [4.3-aggregate-results](4.3-aggregate-results/) |
| 4.4 | Compare performance: sequential vs. parallel | [4.4-compare-speed](4.4-compare-speed/) |
