## Parallel Test Execution Overview

This module focuses on implementing parallel test execution in AWS CodeBuild to optimize test runtime and improve pipeline efficiency. You'll learn how to configure, manage, and monitor parallel test execution in your CI/CD pipeline.

### What You'll Learn

1. Multiple Test Configuration
   - Organizing test projects
   - Test categorization
   - Test prioritization
   - Resource planning

2. Parallel Configuration
   - CodeBuild parallel setup
   - Test runner configuration
   - Resource allocation
   - Environment isolation

3. Result Aggregation
   - Combining test results
   - Reporting strategies
   - Error handling
   - Status consolidation

4. Performance Comparison
   - Measuring improvements
   - Analyzing bottlenecks
   - Optimizing execution
   - Resource utilization

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 3 (Automated Unit Testing)
