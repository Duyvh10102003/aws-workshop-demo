In this section, you'll integrate **CodeQL security analysis** into your GitHub repository. CodeQL helps detect common vulnerabilities such as injection, data leakage, and insecure logic using static analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Enable CodeQL analysis on GitHub
- Review and understand security alerts
- Fix identified vulnerabilities (if any)
- Disable security scanning if unnecessary

## ðŸ§© Steps
