## ‚úÖ Verification

Ensure the following resources are deleted:

| CodeBuild | Project ci-dotnet-unittest |
| CloudWatch | Rule codebuild-failure-rule |
| SNS | Topic test-failure-alerts |
| S3 | Artifacts bucket |

## üß† Tips

- Use AWS CLI for quick deletion of multiple resources:

```bash
# Delete CodeBuild project
aws codebuild delete-project --name ci-dotnet-unittest

# Delete CloudWatch rule
aws events delete-rule --name codebuild-failure-rule

# Delete SNS topic
aws sns delete-topic --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:test-failure-alerts

# Delete S3 bucket (must empty first)
aws s3 rm s3://your-bucket-name --recursive
aws s3 rb s3://your-bucket-name
```
