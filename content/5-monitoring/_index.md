In this section, you'll learn how to set up automatic notifications for test failures using Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and Amazon SNS for notifications.

## üéØ Objectives

- Create automatic notifications (email, SMS...) when a build fails
- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor build status
- Use Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send alerts
- Help managers/devs know immediately when test errors occur

## üß± Implementation Steps

| Step | Brief Description |
|------|------------------|
| 5.1 | Create SNS topic & subscribe email for notifications |
| 5.2 | Create CloudWatch Rule to catch errors from CodeBuild |
| 5.3 | Connect Rule ‚Üí SNS topic to send alerts |
| 5.4 | Test with failed build and verify email reception |

## üåê Architecture Overview

1. CodeBuild executes tests
2. CloudWatch monitors build status
3. When a build failure is detected, CloudWatch Rule is triggered
4. Rule sends notification to SNS Topic
5. SNS sends email to subscribed addresses
