Once automated testing is in place, it's crucial to monitor build processes, view test results, and optimize operational cost. AWS provides tools like **CloudWatch Logs**, **Cost Explorer**, and fine-tuned build configurations to help minimize CI/CD expenses.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- View test logs using CloudWatch Logs
- Analyze build costs with CodeBuild metrics
- Optimize build configuration (time, compute type)
- Estimate resource usage and cost

## ðŸ§© Steps
